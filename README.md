## Svelte-Basics

##Introduction
You'll need to have basic familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to understand Svelte.HTML, CSS and JavaScript that belong together, written into a .svelte file. 
To try Svelte in an interactive online environment you can try the "_REPL_" or "_StackBlitz_".

To create a project locally we recommend using SvelteKit, the official application framework:

npm create svelte@latest myapp           

cd myapp

npm install

npm run dev



##important
SvelteKit will handle calling the Svelte compiler to convert your .svelte files into .js files that create the DOM and .css files that style it. It also provides all the other pieces you need to build a web application such as a development server, routing, and deployment. SvelteKit utilizes Vite to build your code and handle server-side rendering (SSR).
